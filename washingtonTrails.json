You’ll encounter a half dozen waterfalls, old-growth forest, and towering canyon walls. Not surprisingly, Eagle Creek is also one of the most popular trails in the Gorge, so prepare for company. And while dogs are permitted, they're discouraged—the trail has steep drop-offs and rough tread. Children will love this hike, but close supervision is advised.",

The Easton area is home to one of the largest populations of turkey vultures in the state, and the massive birds of prey (or birds of opportunity, if you prefer) soar en masse over the thermal-producing faces of Easton and Kachess ridges. Of course, those big birds of opportunity are here for a reason—the region has healthy populations of mammals, big and small, from marmots to mountain goats, beavers to bull elk. Keep your eyes open and you’ll see a wide range of critters.",

March to early May is prime time to catch the blooming arrowleaf balsamroot and other wildflowers in the open ponderosa pine forest and to see the waterfall at the north end of Hog Canyon. Hog Lake is one of just four in the region designated for winter fishing (December 1–March 31), which overlaps with the end and the beginning of hiking season. Aspens brighten the route in October. Deer, coyotes, and other wildlife are active early on summer mornings, which also is the best time to hike the open portions of this route when daytime temperatures soar.",

Murray Wildlife Area sprawls over the northeastern corner, encompassing both open sagebrush desert and dry pine forest environments, and wonderful blends of the two. As is often the case when hiking in the desert, the best walking route is actually an old road, with optional side trips comprising off-trail rambles whenever you’d like. More than 25 miles of rough dirt roads ramble through this area, with occasional mountain bikes and horses sharing them with hikers. The potential route options are too numerous to list, so consider the following just a teaser to get you started on exploring this glorious desert wildlife haven. Note: Be aware that this area and the access road to hike up into it are typically closed November 1 through April 15 each year to protect wintering elk herds.",

Expect crowds, even in winter, as New Year’s resolutions (the two Si mountains are sometimes colloquially referred to as the “Resolution Peaks” for the deluge of hikers that appear after January 1st), proximity to the city and a degree of refuge from the elements often divert heavy foot traffic to this mini-mountain to keep it busy year round.",

The first fire lookout here was established in 1916; a lowly tent perched on the peak until a cabin with a cupola was built in 1922. This was hit by lightning in 1927 and a second lookout was built, but it was subsequently destroyed in 1965 and never rebuilt. Remains of these structures can still be seen on the mountain, when you can tear yourself away from the view.",

While the PCT followed much of the old Cascade Crest route, this Rock Creek section was replaced when trail builders carved a new high route into the face of Kendall Peak (see Hike 60, Kendall Katwalk). The Rock Creek Trail was forgotten for many years, but hiking legends Harvey Manning and Ira Spring refused to let a good trail die, and they added the path to one of their last guidebooks.

    "summary": "This is a pleasant hike to a small lake and a notched gap with sweeping views. Sheep Lake is nestled in a subalpine area that explodes with wildflowers in July and August. The lake is a good place to relax and enjoy nature or perhaps take off your boots and go wading. Sourdough Gap is a small saddle in a rocky-edged ridge. The hike from the lake to the gap offers increasingly picturesque views of the south Cascades with every foot of altitude you gain. Once at the gap, you will be rewarded with grand views of Sheep Lake on one side and the Crystal Lakes basin on the other side.",

In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks.
